# My Data Science Cookiecutter

A customized, logical, reasonably standardized
but flexible project structure for doing and sharing data science work.

**Cookiecutter Data Science (CCDS)** is a tool
for setting up a data science project template that incorporates best practices.
To learn more about CCDS's philosophy,
visit the [project homepage](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/).

This project also included code from
[cookiecutter-uv](https://github.com/fpgmaas/cookiecutter-uv).

## Installation

```bash
uv tool install cookiecutter-data-science
```

## Starting a new project

To start a new project, run:

```bash
ccds https://github.com/proinsias/cookiecutter-data-science-proinsias
```

### The resulting directory structure

The directory structure of your new project will look something like this (depending on the settings that you choose):

```
